<task>
Generate a complete, deployment-ready system prompt for an AI agent.
Agent role: ${agentName}
Agent specialty: ${agentDesc}${userContext ? `\nUser context: ${userContext}` : ''}
</task>

<instructions>
Think carefully about what a professional in this role actually does day-to-day before generating. Consider their real workflows, the tools they use, the decisions they make, and the stakeholders they interact with.

Generate the system prompt using this exact structure. Every section must contain specific, actionable content — not generic placeholders. Use real industry terminology, real frameworks, real tool names, and real methodologies that a professional in this role would recognize.

## AGENT IDENTITY
Define who this agent is in 2-3 sentences. Include: the agent's name, its core purpose, its domain expertise, and the specific professional role it mirrors. Be concrete — reference the actual industry context.

## CORE CAPABILITIES
List 6-8 specific capabilities as active competencies. Each capability should describe a concrete action the agent can perform, not a vague skill. Use the format: "[Action verb] + [specific deliverable] + [using what method/tool]."

## BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES
Define the agent's personality and interaction style:
- Communication tone (formal/conversational/technical — pick ONE and be specific)
- Response length norms (when to be brief vs. detailed)
- 3-4 "ALWAYS" rules (things this agent must do in every interaction)
- 3-4 "NEVER" rules (things this agent must avoid)
- How to handle ambiguous requests (ask clarifying questions vs. make assumptions)

## DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
List the specific frameworks, methodologies, tools, regulations, and knowledge areas this agent draws from. Use real names — not generic categories. A professional in this field should read this list and recognize every item.

## INTERACTION PROTOCOL
Define how this agent manages conversations:
- How it opens a new conversation (what it asks first)
- How it handles multi-step workflows (does it present a plan before executing?)
- How it delivers complex outputs (structured sections, summaries, or step-by-step?)
- What context it requests from the user before proceeding
- How it confirms understanding before taking action

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Define the default structure of this agent's responses:
- Primary output format (bullets, narrative, tables, code, templates — be specific)
- When to use different formats based on the request type
- Standard sections or headers the agent includes in its deliverables
- Length calibration (approximate word counts for different request types)

## CONSTRAINTS & SAFETY
Define hard boundaries:
- What this agent explicitly will NOT do (scope limits)
- When it must flag uncertainty rather than guess
- When it must recommend human expert review
- Domain-specific ethical or compliance considerations
- How it handles requests outside its expertise (redirect, not fabricate)

## FIRST MESSAGE
Write the exact first message this agent sends when activated. This message should:
- Introduce the agent's role in one sentence
- Ask 1-2 targeted questions to understand the user's specific situation
- Set expectations for what the agent can deliver
</output_format>

<quality_criteria>
- Every section must contain content specific to the ${agentName} role — nothing generic
- Reference real industry tools, frameworks, regulations, and methodologies by name
- A professional in this field should read this prompt and think "this person knows my job"
- The generated prompt must work immediately when pasted into any AI tool's system prompt field
- Total length: 600-900 words. Dense with value, no padding.
